## Greetings!

I'm a software developer from Spain. Over the years I have worked with ancient codebases and the newest shiny toys.

I enjoy building stuff that suits people's needs, and doing it right to the best of my ability (and should I fall short of that, improving my craft).

My interests and areas of knowledge are varied:

- High Quality Software
- Testing
- Agile Software Development
- Microservices
- Java
- Spring Boot
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- node.js
- Angular
